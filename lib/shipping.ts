// THE-772 — shipping cost engine. Pure (no DB), so the same math runs on the server (source of
// truth) and in the client summary.
//
// Each motor's shipping mode follows where it's MADE (set per-model by an admin):
//   • fob    — China-made: air/sea, the customer arranges freight → NO domestic shipping charge
//   • ground — US-made: domestic freight per unit at ship_ground (or ship_expedite if expedited)
// A quote can mix both, so shipping is summed PER LINE by each motor's mode. The customer can't pick
// the mode; they may only request expedite (applies to the US-made / ground lines).
//
// Only motor lines are charged this phase; full window-treatment lines and crown/drive parts are
// free. Standard ground is waived for orders ≥ $1000 or for waived retailers; EXPEDITE is a premium,
// charged unless the retailer is explicitly exempted.
